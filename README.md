PROJECT TITLE : TREASURE HUNT ADVENTURE

RAJA FATASH ABBASI - SP22-BSE-127

The * Hunt Puzzle Game is a logic-based, interactive puzzle-solving game designed to challenge players through a series of brain-teasing riddles and tasks. The game offers an engaging experience where players progress through different levels by solving puzzles that test their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. A hint system is integrated to assist players when needed, though using hints may result in lower scores, encouraging thoughtful play. Players earn points for each correct answer, and their progress can be tracked through a scoring and leaderboard system. Developed using object-oriented principles in C#, the game is structured with clear components such as `Player`, `Puzzle`, `GameEngine`, and `HintManager`, ensuring modularity and scalability. The project showcases use case diagrams, system sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and architectural design to reflect a well-organized development process suitable for both educational and entertainment purposes.
